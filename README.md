<h1 align="center">Damocles</h1>

`Damocles` is a solution for `Filecoin` storage power clusters, focusing on growing and maintaining said storage power. Compared with `lotus`, it tries to make breakthroughs in the following aspects:

- Simplifies sealing state machine
- More efficient usage of resources through optimized procedures
- Taking advantages of Venus chain service and Venus storage deal service to maximize storage providing performance
- Multi miner_id support and collaboration  

`Damocles` is composed of `damocles-worker` and `damocles-manager`. The former is used for `PoRep` computations and latter is used for sector management and interactions with Filecoin chain.

## Building & Documentation

For instructions on how to quickly bootstrap your storage power service using `damocles`, please visit [here](https://damocles.venus-fil.io/intro/).

For instructions on more intricate details of `damocles` configurations, please visit [here](https://github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles/tree/main/docs).

## Venus Architecture

Venus architecture mianly compose of three parts: chain service, storage deal service and storage power service. Learn more about each of them [here](https://sophon.venus-fil.io/intro/#mining-architecture).

## Related Components

Venus loosely describes a collection of components that work together to realize a fully featured Filecoin implementation. List of stand-alone venus modules repos can be found [here](https://venus.filecoin.io/cs/#introducing-venus-components), each assuming different roles in the functioning of Filecoin.

## Contribute

Venus is a universally open project and welcomes contributions of all kinds: code, docs, and more. However, before making a contribution, we ask you to heed these recommendations:

1. If the proposal entails a protocol change, please first submit a [Filecoin Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs).
2. If the change is complex and requires prior discussion, [open an issue](https://github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles/issues) or a [discussion](https://github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles/discussions) to request feedback before you start working on a pull request. This is to avoid disappointment and sunk costs, in case the change is not actually needed or accepted.
