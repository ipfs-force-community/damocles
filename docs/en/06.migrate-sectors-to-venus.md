# Import existing sector data

When one would like to migrate the sector storage directory sealed by other sealer solution to `damocles`, it needs to use `damocles-manager` to import and update the corresponding configuration file.

## Import and verify

**Note**: Both import and validation need to be done without `damocles-manager daemon` being started.

### import

`damocles-manager` provides an import tool called `storage attach`, which can be used as following:
```
damocles-manager util storage attach --verbose --name={storage name} <path>
```

- `name` is an optional parameter;
- `<path>` is the storage path, which is converted to an absolute path during import.

For details of `name` and `<path>`, please refer to [Common.PersistStores](../04.damocles-manager-config.md
#commonpersiststores).

For example, by using...
```
damocles-manager util storage attach --verbose --name=a -v ./mock-tmp/remote
```

logs similar to the following would likely be produced:
```

[[Common.PersistStores]]
Name = "a"
Path = "/home/dtynn/proj/github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles/mock-tmp/remote"
Strict = false
ReadOnly = false
```

At this point, the directory import has been completed, and the location information of all sectors has also been recorded.
We can then complete the import by copying configuration in the output into the configuration file of `damocles-manager`.

#### reimport

If we find that the information supplied during import is wrong, such as `--name` is misspelled, we can re-import with correct information to complete the import process.
The location information of the sector will be overwritten and updated.

#### separation of sealed_file and cache_dir

Some sealer components allow `sealed_file` and `cache_dir` to be on different storage instances, in which case regular import may fail to locate sector files.
In this case, you can enable the split scan mode by adding the command line parameter `--allow-splitted`. In this mode, paths in the `sealed` folder and the `cache` folder that match the sector naming rules will be scanned separately.

At this point, the log will look similar to:
```

Name = "p3"
Path = "/home/dtynn/proj/github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles/
mock-tmp/pstore3"

ReadOnly = false
```

Notes for using this mode:

- There are no duplicate stored files due to storage exceptions in the target directory
- Sectors with only `cache_dir` and no corresponding `sealed_file` won't be located

### Validation

The `storage find` tool provided by `damocles-manager` can be used to check whether the result of sector import is correct. It can be used as following:
```
damocles-manager util storage find <miner actor id> <sector number>
```

Continuing with an example of the validation command demonstrated above, we want to verify that the sector `s-t010000-17` has been recorded correctly, we can use:
```
damocles-manager util storage find 10000 17
```

Usually a log similar to the following would be produced:
```
2022-04-19T19:13:15.235+0800 DEBUG policy policy/const.go:18 NETWORK SETUP {"name": "mainnet"}
2022-04-19T19:13:15.249+0800 INFO cmd internal/util_storage.go:279 sector s-t010000-17 located, sealed file in "a", cache dir in "a"
2022-04-19T19:13:15.249+0800 INFO cmd internal/util_storage.go:285 store instance exists {"instance": "a"}
2022-04-19T19:13:15.249+0800 INFO cmd internal/util_storage.go:285 store instance exists {"instance": "a"}
```

This means that our import and configuration work is complete.

#### Validation exception: sector information was not recorded successfully

If you encounter something like the following during the verification process...
```
2022-03-11T16:45:59.120+0800 WARN cmd internal/util_storage.go:214 s-t010000-17 not found
```
Such log indicates that the specified sector was not imported successfully, and we need to recheck the import process.

#### Validation exception: Storage configuration not updated

If you encounter something like the following during the verification process...
```
2022-03-11T16:22:34.044+0800 DEBUG policy policy/const.go:18 NETWORK SETUP {"name": "mainnet"}
2022-03-11T16:22:34.059+0800 INFO cmd internal/util_storage.go:218 found s-t010000-17 in "a"
2022-03-11T16:22:34.059+0800 WARN cmd internal/util_storage.go:227 store instance not found, check your config file
```
Such a log indicates that the configuration file of `damocles-manager` has not been successfully updated, and we need to update the configuration according to the method mentioned above.
