# damocles-worker task management

In the previous document, we mentioned that in the `damocles` architecture, the process management of a sector is by `worker`.

Therefore, the management of sector tasks, especially exception handling, is also performed by the `worker` instance where the sector is being processed.

However, it must be very inconvenient if all status checking and exception handling require remote access to the corresponding `worker` machine to operate.

Therefore, in v0.2.0 and later versions, workers report status to sector-manager, and sector-manager manages workers remotely.

Below, we will explain both how worker can be managed locally and how sector-manager manage workers remotely.

## damocles-worker local management

The local management of `damocles-worker` is mainly through a set of tools provided to call the management interface to operate…


```
./dist/damocles-worker worker
```

With subcommands like…

- list
- pause
- resume


### list

`list` is used to list the current state of all `sealing_thread`s in the currently running `damocles-worker` instance.

```
damocles-worker worker -c <config file path> list
```

Let's take the mock configuration in the codebase as an example:

```
$ ./dist/damocles-worker worker -c ./damocles-worker/assets/damocles-worker.mock.toml list

#0: "/home/dtynn/proj/github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles/mock-tmp/store1"; sector_id=Some(s-t010000-2), paused=true, paused_elapsed=Some (17s), state=C1Done, last_err=Some("permanent: No cached parameters found for stacked-proof-of-replication-merkletree-poseidon_hasher-8-0-0-sha256_hasher-032d3138d22506ec0082ed72b2dcba18df18477904e35bafee82b3793/cointmpail/var finding [f3793/cointmpail/var] -proof-parameters/v28-stacked-proof-of-replication-merkletree-poseidon_hasher-8-0-0-sha256_hasher-032d3138d22506ec0082ed72b2dcba18df18477904e35bafee82b3793b06832f.params]")
#1: "/home/dtynn/proj/github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles/mock-tmp/store2"; sector_id=Some(s-t010000-3), paused=true, paused_elapsed=Some (17s), state=C1Done, last_err=Some("permanent: No cached parameters found for stacked-proof-of-replication-merkletree-poseidon_hasher-8-0-0-sha256_hasher-032d3138d22506ec0082ed72b2dcba18df18477904e35bafee82b3793/cointmpail/var finding [f3793/cointmpail/var] -proof-parameters/v28-stacked-proof-of-replication-merkletree-poseidon_hasher-8-0-0-sha256_hasher-032d3138d22506ec0082ed72b2dcba18df18477904e35bafee82b3793b06832f.params]")
#2: "/home/dtynn/proj/github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles/mock-tmp/store3"; sector_id=Some(s-t010000-1), paused=true, paused_elapsed=Some (17s), state=C1Done, last_err=Some("permanent: No cached parameters found for stacked-proof-of-replication-merkletree-poseidon_hasher-8-0-0-sha256_hasher-032d3138d22506ec0082ed72b2dcba18df18477904e35bafee82b3793/cointmpail/var finding [f3793/cointmpail/var] -proof-parameters/v28-stacked-proof-of-replication-merkletree-poseidon_hasher-8-0-0-sha256_hasher-032d3138d22506ec0082ed72b2dcba18df18477904e35bafee82b3793b06832f.params]")
```

As you can see, for each `sealing_thread` , it will list

- Index number
- Local storage location information
- Sector ID (if there is a sector task being processed)
- If the task is paused
- Paused time (if there are paused sector tasks)
- current status
- Last exception information (if there is a sector task suspended due to exception)



### pause

`pause` is used to pause the `sealing_thread` with the specified index number.

```
$ damocles-worker worker -c <config file path> pause --index <index>
```

Note that:

- `index` needs to match the index number from `list` command.



### resume

`resume` is used to resume a suspended `sealing_thread`. 

```
damocles-worker worker -c <config file path> resume [--state <state>] --index <index>
```

Note that:

- `index` needs to match the index number from `list` command.
- `state` is optional.

If state is not supplied, the sector will try to restart with the current state; if the correct `state` value is supplied, it will restart with the specified state

For different `sealing_thread` task types, the optional status values ​​can be found in [11. Task Status Flow](./11.task-status-flow.md)



## damocles-manager remote management of damocles-worker

The management of damocles-worker by damocles-manager is mainly in two aspects:

1. Receive periodic report information of the worker instance
2. Call the management interface on the specified damocles-worker instance

Remote management is done through a set of tools provided to call the management interface of damocles-manager, or a proxy call to the management interface of the specified damocles-worker.

```
./dist/damocles-manager util worker
```

The subcommands included are:

- list
- info
- pause
- resume

### list

The `list` here is used to list the worker profiles that have reported information to this `damocles-manager` instance, for example:

```
$ ./dist/damocles-manager util worker list
Name Dest Threads Empty Paused Errors LastPing(with ! if expired)
127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1:17890 3 0 3 3 2.756922465s
```

As you can see, for each instance, it will list:

- instance name (if no instance name is specified, it will be the ip used to connect to `damocles-manager`)
- instance connection information
- `sealing_thread` number
- The number of empty `sealing_thread`
- The number of suspended `sealing_thread`
- The number of `sealing_thread` that have reported errors
- The interval from the last report to the current time



### info / pause / resume

This set of commands is executed against the specified damocles-worker instance.

Their effects are equivalent to `damocles-worker`’s own `list` / `pause` / `resume`, which are used in the following ways.

- `damocles-manager util worker info <worker instance name or address>`
- `damocles-manager util worker pause <worker instance name or address> <thread index>`
- `damocles-manager util worker resume <worker instance name or address> <thread index> [<next state>]`

Specific information can be viewed through `help`, and the definition and effect of parameters are consistent with the `damocles-worker` management tool.

for example:

```
$ ./dist/damocles-manager util worker info 127.0.0.1
