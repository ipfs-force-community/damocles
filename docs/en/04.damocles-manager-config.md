# Configuration of damocles-manager

`damocles-manager` is the main component for interacting with the chain and maintaining the sectors. Let's take a look at its configuration file structure.

After initialization, we can get a copy of the default configuration:

```toml

We will break down each configurable item one by one.


## [Common]

`Common` section includes common configuration, which is further divided into four sub-configuration items:



### [Common.API]

`Common.API` is interface related configuration, its content includes:

```toml
[Common.API]
# Gateway service infos, required, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
# For each one contained, if the item is valid as a token-included-info-string ("{token}:{multiaddr}"), the token included would be used to construct the rpc client instead of the common token.
Gateway = ["/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"]

# common token for services, required, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
Token = "{some token}"

# Chain service info, optional, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
# If the field is valid as a token-included-info-string ("{token}:{multiaddr}"), the token included would be used to construct the rpc client instead of the common token.
# If not set, use value of Gateway as default 
Chain = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"

# Message service info, optional, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
# If the field is valid as a token-included-info-string ("{token}:{multiaddr}"), the token included would be used to construct the rpc client instead of the common token.
# If not set, use value of Gateway as default 
Messager = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"

# Market service info, optional, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
# If the field is valid as a token-included-info-string ("{token}:{multiaddr}"), the token included would be used to construct the rpc client instead of the common token.
# If not set, use value of Gateway as default 
Market = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"

# Interval time for detecting chain height changes, optional, duration type
# Default is 1min
#ChainEventInterval = "1m0s"
```

### [Common.Plugins]
`Common.Plugins` is used for configuring the plugin path of damocles-manager.

```toml
[Common.Plugins]
# Path where plugins are stored, optionalï¼Œstring type
# Default is an empty string, which means that no plugin will be loaded.
# It is recommended to use absolute paths.
Dir = ""
```

### [[Common.PieceStores]]

`Common.PieceStores` is used for configuring local deal `piece` data. When there is available offline deal, you can configure this item to avoid getting the deal `piece` data through public network traffic.

Each local store directory should correspond to a `Common.PieceStores` configuration block.



#### Basic configuration example

```toml
[[Common.PieceStores]]
# name, optional, string type
# The default is the absolute path corresponding to the path
#Name = "remote-store1"

# path, required, string type
Path = "/mnt/mass/piece1"

# Plugin path, optional, string type
# default is null
# If you would like to use a custom storage scheme, you can write a golang plugin that meets the requirements and set it here.
# Deprecated, Please use PluginName instead.
#Plugin = "path/to/objstore-plugin"

# Plugin path, optional, string type
# default is empty string
# If you would like to use a custom storage scheme, you can write a golang plugin that meets the requirements and set it here.
#PluginName = "s3store"

# Meta information, optional items, dictionary type
# The internal value is in the format of Key = "Value"
# Default value is null
# Used to support different types of storage schemes
[Common.PieceStores.Meta]
#SomeKey = "SomeValue"
#
```



### [[Common.PersistStores]]

`Common.PersistStores` is used to configure sector persistent data stores. It corresponds to the `attached` concept in `damocles-worker`.

Similar to `Common.PieceStores`, each persistent store directory should correspond to a `Common.PersistStores` configuration block.



#### Basic configuration example

```toml
[[Common.PersistStores]]
# name, optional, string type
## Default is the absolute path corresponding to the path
#Name = "remote-store1"

# path, required, string type
# It is recommended to use absolute paths
Path = "/mnt/remote/10.0.0.14/store"

# read only, optional, boolean
# Default is false
# From v0.4.0 and above, the persistent storage allocation logic goes to damocles-manager
# This configuration can be used to set whether you can continue to write to the storage
#ReadOnly = false

# optional, boolean
# Default is false
# Whether to validate if the Path is a regular file. If set to True, an error will be raised if the Path is a non-regular file, such as a symbolic link.
#Strict = false

# weight, optional, number type
# Default is 1
# When the filled value is 0, it is equivalent to 1
# From v0.4.0 and above, the persistent storage allocation logic goes to damocles-manager
# This configuration can be used to set the weight allocation ratio between multiple persistent stores
# The probability of each persistent stores being selected is `weight / sum`, where `sum` is the sum of the weights of all available persistent stores.
# Example: Configure 3 persistent stores, the weights are 2, 1, 1. The probability of being selected is 50%, 25%, 25% respectively
#Weight = 1

# Plugin path, optional, string type
# default is null
# If you want to use a custom storage scheme, you can write a golang plugin that meets the requirements and set it here.
# Deprecated, Please use PluginName instead.
#Plugin = "path/to/objstore-plugin"

# List of miner IDs that are allowed, optional, numeric array type
# default is null
# When not set, it is regarded as allowing all miner IDs; when set, it is equivalent to a whitelist, which allows only listed miner IDs
# If a miner ID appears in AllowMiners and DenyMiners at the same time, DenyMiners will take effect first, which is considered blacklisted
#AllowMiners = [1, 2]

# List of miner IDs that are being denied, optional, numeric array type
# default is null
# When not set, it is regarded as not rejecting any miner number; when set, it is equivalent to a blacklist, which will deny the listed miner ID
# If a miner ID appears in both AllowMiners and DenyMiners, DenyMiners will take effect first, which is considered blacklisted
#DenyMiners = [3, 4]

# Plugin path, optional, string type
# default is empty string
# If you would like to use a custom storage scheme, you can write a golang plugin that meets the requirements and set it here.
#PluginName = "s3store"

# Meta information, optional items, dictionary type
# The internal value is in the format of Key = "Value"
# Default value is null
# Used to support the preparation of different types of storage schemes, currently has no effect
[Common.PersistStores.Meta]
#SomeKey = "SomeValue"
#
```

### [Common.MongoKVStore] `Deprecated`

`Common.MongoKVStore` is used to configure whether `damocles-manager` use MongoDB as KV database during sealing.

#### Basic configuration example
```toml
[Common.MongoKVStore]
# Switch of Mongo KV, optional, boolean type
# default is false 
Enable = true
# DSN of Mongo, when `Enable` is true, `DSN` is required, string type.
DSN = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000"
# DatabaseName of Mongo, when `Enable` is true, `DatabaseName` is required, string type.
DatabaseName = "test"
```

### [Common.Proving]
Proving used to control the number of proving parallels and check timeouts.

example:
```toml
# Maximum number of sector checks to run in parallel, optional, time type
# Default is 128. (0 = unlimited)
# WARNING: Setting this value too high may make the node crash by running out of stack
# WARNING: Setting this value too low may make sector challenge reading much slower, resulting in failed PoSt due
# to late submission.
#ParallelCheckLimit = 128
# Maximum amount of time a proving pre-check can take for a sector, optional, time type
# Default is 10m0s.
# If the check times out the sector will be skipped
# WARNING: Setting this value too low risks in sectors being skipped even though they are accessible, just reading the test challenge took longer than this timeout
# WARNING: Setting this value too high risks missing PoSt deadline in case IO operations related to this sector are blocked (e.g. in case of disconnected NFS mount)
#SingleCheckTimeout = "10m0s"
# Maximum amount of time a proving pre-check can take for an entire partition, optional time type
# Default is 20m0s.
# If the check times out, sectors in the partition which didn't get checked on time will be skipped
# WARNING: Setting this value too low risks in sectors being skipped even though they are accessible, just reading the test challenge took longer than this timeout
# WARNING: Setting this value too high risks missing PoSt deadline in case IO operations related to this partition are blocked or slow
#PartitionCheckTimeout = "20m0s"
```

### [Common.Proving.WorkerProver]
Used to configure the worker prover module

example:
```toml
# The maximum number of attempts of the WindowPoSt job, optional, number type
# Default is 2
# job that exceeds the JobMaxTry number can only be re-executed by manual reset
JobMaxTry = 2
# The timeout of the WindowPoSt job's heartbeat, optional, time type
# Default is 15s
# jobs that have not sent a heartbeat for more than this time will be set to fail and retried
HeartbeatTimeout = "15s"
# The heartbeat timeout of the WindowPoSt job, optional, time type
# Default is 25h
# WindowPoSt jobs created longer than this time will be deleted
JobLifetime = "25h0m0s"
```

### [Common.DB]

`Common.DB` is used to configure  KV database used by `damocles-manager` during sealing. Currently, the `badger` local database and `mongo` database are supported.

#### Basic configuration example:
```toml
[Common.DB]
# Specify database, optional, string type
# Default is badger
# All options: badger | mongo | plugin
Driver = "badger"
[Common.DB.Badger]
# Basedir of the badger, optional, string type
# Default value is empty string
# Use home dir (default is ~/.damocles-manager) to store badger database files if BaseDir is empty string
#BaseDir = ""
[Common.DB.Mongo]
# DSN of Mongo, when `Enable` is true, `DSN` is required, string type.
DSN = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000"
# DatabaseName of Mongo, when `Enable` is true, `DatabaseName` is required, string type.
DatabaseName = "test"
[Common.DB.Plugin]
# The plugin name, optionalï¼Œstring type
# Default is null
PluginName = "redis"
# Metadata, optional, dict type
# The internal value is in the format of Key = "Value"
# Default is null
# The Metadata will be pass to the constructor of the plugin
[Common.DB.Plugin.Meta]
#SomeKey = "SomeValue"
#
```

## [[Miners]]

`Miners` is an important configuration item, which is used to define behavior and policy for a certain `SP`.

`damocles` is designed to support multiple `SP`s with the same set of components. This is reflected in `damocles-manager`, which you can set multiple `Miners` configuration blocks as needed.



### Main configuration item

```toml
[[Miners]]
# `SP` actor id, required, numeric type
Actor = 10086
```

In addition to the main configuration, `Miners` also contains a number of different sub-configuration blocks, let's go through them one by one


### [Miners.Sector]

Policy used to control sector allocation.

```toml
[Miners.Sector]
# Sector start number, optional, number type
# Default value is 0

# Compared with InitNumber, when this is set,
# 1. At any time, the allocator will not give a sector number less than or equal to this value.
# 2. The value of this item can be adjusted during cluster operation.
# Increase the config value, the assignment result will always follow the description of 1).
# Lowering the config value usually has no effect.
#
# When this item is not set, if InitNumber is a non-zero value, it is equivalent to this item.
#MinNumber = 10

# Sector number upper limit, optional, number type
# The default value is null, which means no upper limit
#MaxNumber = 1000000

# Whether to allow allocation of sectors, optional, boolean type

### [Miners.Commitment.Prove]

The strategy used to configure `ProveCommit` message sending, its configuration items and functions are exactly the same as those in `Miners.Commitment.Pre`.



### [Miners.Commitment.Terminate]

The strategy used to configure `TerminateSectors` message submission, its configuration items and functions are basically the same as those in `Miners.Commitment.Pre`. In practice, such messages are not sent as frequently. It is recommended to use single message sending mode. When using aggregate sending mode, `Threshold` is recommended to be configured with a smaller value to ensure that messages get on-chain in time.



### [Miners.PoSt]

# Stable height to submit WindowPoSt proofs, optional, number type
# This value determines how many epochs to wait for the chain to enter a stable state, so that we could start submiting proofs
# The first epoch we can submit is deadline.Open + SubmitConfidence
# The smaller this value is set, the earlier it will start, but at the same time, more likely to send windowPost to a fork
# When set to 0, the default value of 4 will be used
#SubmitConfidence = 0

# Stable height to start WindowPoSt, optional, number type
# This value determines how many epochs to wait for the chain to enter a stable state, and the WindowPoSt task can be started
# The first epoch we can start is deadline.Challenge + ChallengeConfidence
# The smaller this value is set, the earlier it will start, but at the same time, more likely to send windowPost to a fork

# Default is false
#Enabled = false
```

### [Miners.Sealing]

Used to configure sealing related policies

```toml
[Miners.Sealing]
# Sealing need how many epochs to achieveï¼Œwhen select deals in sealing, deals start epoch will be
# required to later than current-epoch + sealing-duration ï¼Œoptionalï¼Œinteger
# Default is zero, means no config
#SealingEpochDuration = 0
#
# weather to use SyntheticPoRep , optional, boolean type
# default is false
#UseSyntheticPoRep = false
```


### [Miners.Deal] `Deprecated`

Used to configure deal related policies.

```toml
[Miners.Deal]
# Whether to enable, optional, boolean type
# Default is false
#Enabled = false
```



## A minimal working configuration file example

Let's have a look at an example of starting a `damocles-manager` that could supports a `SP`'s operation,

```toml
[Common]
[Common.API]
Gateway = ["/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"]
Token = "{some token}"
Chain = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"
Messager = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"
Market = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"

[[Common.PieceStores]]
Path = "{store_path}"

[[Common.PersistStores]]
Name = "{store_name1}"
Path = "{store_path1}"

[[Common.PersistStores]]
Name = "{store_name2}"
Path = "{store_path2}"

[[Common.PersistStores]]
Name = "{store_name3}"
Path = "{store_path3}"

[[Common.PersistStores]]
Name = "{store_name4}"
Path = "{store_path4}"

[[Miners]]
Actor = 10086
[Miners.Sector]
InitNumber = 1000
Enabled = true
EnableDeals = true

[Miners.Commitment]
[Miners.Commitment.Pre]
Sender = "t1abjxfbp274xpdqcpuaykwkfb43omjotacm2p3za"

[Miners.Commitment.Pre.Batch]
Enabled = false

[Miners.Commitment.Prove]
Sender = "t1abjxfbp274xpdqcpuaykwkfb43omjotacm2p3za"

[Miners.Commitment.Prove.Batch]
Enabled = true

[Miners.Post]
Sender = "t1abjxfbp274xpdqcpuaykwkfb43omjotacm2p3za"
Enabled = true

[Miners.Proof]
Enabled = true

```

This activates an instance of `damocles-manager` that...

- With 1 local PieceStore
- With 4 local persistent stores
- Enables sector allocation, which initial number is 1000
- Disables aggregated PreCommit
- Enables aggregated ProveCommit
- Enables WinningPost module
- Enables deal
