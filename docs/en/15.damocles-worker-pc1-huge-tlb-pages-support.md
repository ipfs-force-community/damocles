# Damocles-worker PC1 Huge TLB Pages support.

In the PC1 phase, `rust-fil-proofs` will mmap two large chunks of memory consistent with the sector size. If these two memory chunks are in the same NUMA node as the PC1 worker threads, it can effectively improve performance. Using [HugeTLB Pages](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.16/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.html) will also bring some performance improvement.

Through testing, even with [numa_preferred](./03.damocles-worker%E7%9A%84%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90.md#processorsstage_name) configured, the system often still requests these two memory chunks across NUMA nodes after running for some time. Using our modified [rust-fil-proofs](https://github.com/ipfs-force-community/rust-fil-proofs/tree/force/master_v12.0.0) (the current version of damocles-worker already supports it), we can use pre-created hugepage memory files consistent with the sector size that are dedicated to the demand of the above two large memory chunks in the PC1 phase. This can alleviate the problem to some extent.

Note: The original mmap approach has the advantage that the memory requested by mmap is managed by the OS, so it can work properly even under memory shortage (severe memory shortage may lead to performance degradation). Users can choose whether to use this feature according to their own needs.

## Usage

The following will demonstrate enabling two PC1 external executor subprocesses, with the two PC1 subprocesses running on NUMA0 and NUMA1 respectively. And the concurrency of each PC1 subprocess is 1.

### 1. Allocate enough Persistent hugepages for each NUMA node.

A single PC1 task needs 64 GiB of persistent hugepages. Users should allocate enough persistent hugepages according to their own requirements.

The following command demonstrates allocating 128 GiB of persistent hugepages:

```shell
#Allocate 64GiB of Persistent HugeTLB Pages memory with PageSize 1GiB for NUMA node 0

$ echo "64" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-1048576kB/nr\_hugepages

#Allocate 64GiB of Persistent HugeTLB Pages memory with PageSize 1GiB for NUMA node 1

$ echo "64" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/node/node1/hugepages/hugepages-1048576kB/nr\_hugepages
```

For more information, please refer to [HugeTLB Pages](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.16/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.html).

### 2. Mount hugetlbfs

```shell
sudo mkdir /mnt/huge\_1g

sudo mount -t hugetlbfs -o pagesize=1g none /mnt/huge\_1g
```
The above mount command will mount the (virtual) `hugetlbfs` filesystem to `/mnt/huge_1g` directory. Any files created under `/mnt/huge_1g` directory will use huge pages.

For more information, please refer to [Using Huge Pages](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.16/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.html#using-huge-pages).

### 3. Use damocles-worker-store-hugepage-init tool to create hugepage memory files

Usage:
```
damocles-worker-store-hugepage-file-init 

USAGE:
   damocles-worker store hugepage-file-init --node <numa_node_index> --num <number_of_files> --path <path> --path_pattern <path_pattern> --size <size>

FLAGS:
   -h, --help       
            Prints help information

   -V, --version    
            Prints version information


OPTIONS:
   -n, --node <numa_node_index>         
            Specify the numa node

   -c, --num <number_of_files>          
            Specify the number of hugepage memory files to be created

      --path <path>                    
            Specify the path to the output hugepage memory files and using the default pattern
            (/specified_hugepage_file_path/numa_$NUMA_NODE_INDEX).
            The created files looks like this:
            /specified_hugepage_file_path/numa_0/file
            /specified_hugepage_file_path/numa_1/file
            /specified_hugepage_file_path/numa_2/file
            ...
            
            This argument will be ignored if `path_pattern` is specified.
      --path_pattern <path_pattern>    
            Specify the path pattern for the output hugepage memory files where $NUMA_NODE_INDEX represents 
            the numa node index placeholder, which extracts the number in the folder name as the numa node index.
            
            If both the argument `path` and the argument `path_pattern` are specified, the argument `path` will be
            ignored.
   -s, --size <size>                    
            Specify the size of each hugepage memory file. (e.g., 1B, 2KB, 3kiB, 1MB, 2MiB, 3GB, 1GiB, ...)

```

Example:
```shell
$ # Create 2 hugepage memory files with size 32GiB on NUMA node 0
$ sudo ./dist/bin/damocles-worker store hugepage-file-init --node=0 --num=2 --size=32GiB --path="/mnt/huge\_1g/pc1\_1"

$ # Create 2 hugepage memory files with size 32GiB on NUMA node 1
$ sudo ./dist/bin/damocles-worker store hugepage-file-init --node=1 --num=2 --size=32GiB --path="/mnt/huge\_1g/pc1\_2"

$ tree /mnt/huge_1g
/mnt/huge_1g
├── pc1_1
│   └── numa_0
│       ├── 32.0_GiB_0
│       └── 32.0_GiB_1
└── pc1_2
    └── numa_1
        ├── 32.0_GiB_0
        └── 32.0_GiB_1

4 directories, 4 files
```

### 4. Configure pc1 processor
```toml
# damocles-worker.toml

[[processors.pc1]]
# ...
envs = { HUGEPAGE_FILES_PATH = "/mnt/huge_1g/pc1_1", ... }
concurrent = 1
# ...

[[processors.pc1]]
# ...
envs = { HUGEPAGE_FILES_PATH = "/mnt/huge_1g/pc1_2", ... }
concurrent = 1
# ...

```

### 5. Start damocles-worker

After starting damocles-worker, if log level is trace and the following logs appear, it indicates the HugeTLb files are configured successfully.
